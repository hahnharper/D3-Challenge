		  <h2>Correlation Between Poverty and Access to Healthcare</h2>
		  <br>
          <p>In this activity, we are analysing how poverty impacts a person's access to healthcare across the United States.
			The percentage of those considered to be "in poverty" and those who lack access to healthcare is measured at a state-level. 
			Each circle on the graph represents one of the 50 states. When the user hovers over a circle, a pop-up will give them the full name
			of the state and the numerical values of the "in poverty" and "lack of healthcare" percentages. </p>

           <p>Based off our data and the graphic, it appears a positive correlation exisits between poverty and lack of access to healthcare. We can also
			  see that these numbers differ depending on the state. For example, Massachusetts has a higher percent of people in poverty compared to New Hampshire.
			  However, New Hampshire has more people who lack access to healthcare than Massachusetts. This could mean Massachusetts dedicates more economic resources
			   towards funding health-based initiatives, or New Hampshire doesn't have as strong a health infrastructure as Massachusetts.
			
			<p>When reading this graph, it is important to remember the United States does not have a universal healthcare system. One's ability to access healthcare 
				and the quality of this healthcare is highly dependent on socioeconomic status. Health care systems across states also vary, meaning some
				states are better equipped to provide the local population with the healthcare they need while others cannot.</p>
